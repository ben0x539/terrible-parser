Back in high school I wanted to write a simple parser for arithmetic
expressions in Java. Java applets seemed like a good idea at the time and we
didn't know any better. I also didn't know what the hell I was doing back then
and couldn't wrap my head around operator precedence and associativity, and
declared that Java was clearly not suitable for writing parsers in, moved on
with my life and enrolled in university to study something that didn't involve
parsers.

YEARS IN THE FUTURE I still don't know what the hell I am doing, but I couldn't
help but see some shreds of parser code and interact with some programming
languages with a more intriguing precedence and associativity story, and
incidentally have given up on that whole university thing. So I am giving this
another shot.

I'm consciously staying away from things like "pertinent literature" and
"parser generators" and other good ideas because I want to do this whole
exploratory programming thing and make stuff up as I go along. Consequently
the code in this project is going to be really terrible, because as soon as I
feel I've figured out what I'm doing, I'm going to move on. It also doesn't
help that I basically don't know Java.
